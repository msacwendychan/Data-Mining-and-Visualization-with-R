# R Mining and Visualization

This project uses R to explore a set of data "yeast.data" and operate statistics analysis on it. A model is trained and tested for classifying the data into categories using decision tree. The classification model then is displayed with graphs including decision tree and heatmap showing how the decisions made.  

## Built with

* [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

## Package Used
* [party](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/party/versions/1.3-1) - for generating the tree regression model 
* [caret](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/6.0-80) - for training the regression model and building Confusion Matrices showing the statistics of the model
* [ggplot2](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.1.0) - for generating the visuals such as heatmap
